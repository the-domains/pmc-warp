description: "PMC Workforce and Readiness Professionals, LLC (\"PMC WaRP\") is a DC-based business specializing in the investment of tomorrow: Human Capital or the workforce. Moving swiftly through the technology age, workforce requirements are changing just as fast. The car manufacturing plant of tomorrow is filled with computer and mechanical engineers, not \"blue collar workers\" on the line. The Tesla manufacturing plant is filled with very precise robotic arms and computers that run and calibrate them to build the cars. Employees, logically, are people who keep those robotic arms and computers running while others are designing new code to improve efficiency or design new cars. That's one example of how the workforce is changing right now."
