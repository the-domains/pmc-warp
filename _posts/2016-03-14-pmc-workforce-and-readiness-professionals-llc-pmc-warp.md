PMC Workforce and Readiness Professionals, LLC ("**PMC WaRP**") is a DC-based business specializing in the investment of tomorrow: Human Capital or the workforce. Moving swiftly through the technology age, workforce requirements are changing just as fast. The car manufacturing plant of tomorrow is filled with computer and mechanical engineers, not "blue collar workers" on the line. The Tesla manufacturing plant is filled with very precise robotic arms and computers that run and calibrate them to build the cars. Employees, logically, are people who keep those robotic arms and computers running while others are designing new code to improve efficiency or design new cars. That's one example of how the workforce is changing right now.

PMC WaRP provides consulting, management, services, and solutions for a variety of workforce needs. College, Career, Workforce, and Re-Entry Readiness are core strengths we provide to governments, nonprofits, corrections systems, colleges and universities, and other clients. Integrating a deep knowledge and understanding of workforce needs, education and economic challenges, lack of access to information and services, and for many just not knowing what they don't know - we've designed the best solutions in the industry!

Whether it is entering college from high school, entering the job market from college, changing careers or jobs, or re-entering society from the corrections system, PMC WaRP enables every person we touch to achieve their goals.

Education is important! But...so is the fundamental fabric of what IS finance, understanding yourself and your passions, knowing where to get the education you need to succeed, knowing where the jobs are, having a path that navigates well beyond the "last mile failure" most of today's college students fall victim to in their final year, soft skills like interviewing and etiquette, and a host of other common core skills you just won't get from most schools. More importantly, students don't know to ask because they don't know what they don't know!

_Story_: A student is super ambitious to be a doctor, so she or he starts at a four-year university as a Pre-Med student! Great for him or her, then life happens and four years turns into five, five into six, and so on... The easiest major to switch to in order to "just graduate" seems to be Psychology, which will accept most of the heavy science credits taken thus far. What they won't get from the Counselor or general knowledge is that a Bachelor's degree in Psychology doesn't afford much at all in that field. Without a Master's or PhD, there is nothing in the Psychology field even remotely associated with the degree. A clinician holds a PhD and a Psychiatrist is a physician who went to medical school and specialized in Psychiatry, so "just graduating" with a Bachelor's in Psychology isn't the best solution for the issue of "life" in this scenario.
